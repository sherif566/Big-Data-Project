       "'Pitt seems to get by entirely on dumb ideas and reckless luck. In the end, he\\'s an action hero in name only. Packed with pithy dialog, lusty action and suspense, and logically and well-devised situations avoiding ultra-theatrics throughout. Unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark, which this movie wants so desperately to be, there\\'s nothing here to engage the brain along with the eyeballs. [M]ight actually be worthy of licking the boots of Raiders of the Lost Ark... Sahara has lots of sound and fury trying to cover up for a hopelessly meandering story and a dull hero. A little inventiveness is one thing, but this movie strains credibility at every turn. Like a lightweight novel suitable for beach reading, Sahara is mildly entertaining, but I can\\'t recommend it. Operating with a machine-tooled efficiency, Sahara seems blithely unaware of its utter predictability. Despite the vast beauty of location settings in Morocco and Spain, the vast lack of chemistry between the two stars is appalling. The filmmakers move between their two lesser plots with a motley assortment of plot holes, contrivances and fantastically preposterous leaps which grow more and more incredulous as the film progresses. Sahara is many things, but it is not a movie. It is the skull-splitting cacophony of 21 producers and four screenwriters (that we know about, anyway) standing in the same room shouting into their cell phones. Dirk is less the \"adventurer\" of the novels than a very tanned, very bland former Navy SEAL/current treasure hunter/archaeologist, the average capitalist yahoo. As barren as the actual Sahara, but without the grand lure, this movie is plain old stoo-pid... No one seems to know what they\\'re doing, or worse, much care. You have to question the wisdom of optioning a Cussler book and hiring a pack of writers to transform it into generic drivel -- surely it would have been cheaper to commission original claptrap. This one has everything: stereotyped characters, shaky camera work, absurdly inappropriate pop songs on the soundtrack, a confused tone, misplaced zaniness and a nonsensical story. It ain\\'t art, and it\\'s dumber than I\\'d like, but I don\\'t imagine you were expecting Kieslowski. McConaughey and his co-stars make the case that fun, however fleeting, is still fun. From the opening civil war naval battle to the closing credits, I was glued to this film with non-stop action. Don\\'t miss it! There\\'s no disguising the fact that Sahara has all the heft of marshmallow. For \"Sahara,\" the problem is that we have the Indiana Jones movies to compare it to, and I\\'m afraid there\\'s no comparison. It\\'s never more than a likable poseur. It\\'s a little hard to have silly fun when you are constantly being reminded that Hotel Rwanda and similar stories have been playing out down the road. \\'National Treasure Lite\\'... a movie that would probably be perfect in-flight entertainment, or maybe even a decent video rental on a night when you\\'re in an undemanding mood. It\\'s a pleasure to see a potential franchise develop from such an unlikely source. For an adventure movie based on chase scenes in exotic locations \"Sahara\" never takes hold because director Breck Eisner and his team of screenwriters can\\'t agree on what the story\\'s about or what tone should resonate against it. This is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 special. It\\'s not a terrible film. It\\'s not particularly good, either, but it\\'s certainly no disaster. Breck Eisner\\'s youthful, fresh grasp of the high-adventure genre. This should have been his audition reel for helming 007/21. Like the African desert that lends the film its name, this so-called adventure is coarse, dry, and overheated. Let\\'s hope today\\'s 10-year-old boys aren\\'t too jaded by Matrix reruns to enjoy this for the good clean fun that it is. As dry and lifeless as its sun-burnt locale. Entertaining but flawed popcorn fare. A marginal adventure story from Clive Cussler\\'s freewheeling novel. A hot-buttered popcorn flick that\\'s deserted by its writers in the last act. With a running time of a few minutes over two hours, Sahara sputters along as slowly as a trek across the desert. Insanely busy, exceedingly long, and sometimes endearingly preposterous. How many leaps of logic do you allow an action movie before that thin strand of suspended disbelief snaps? ...the overriding lesson here is that if we don\\'t go looking to Matthew McConaughey for gravitas, we\\'ll probably have a good time. Sahara\\'s biggest problem is twofold: the film\\'s subtle ideological bent is alarming, and, in the lead, McConaughey is only just barely tolerable. It may not be Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Sahara, the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler\\'s sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. Sahara is an Indiana Jones rip-off so dull that it gives me newfound respect for Cannon Films\\' 1985 version of King Solomon\\'s Mines. If you like movies that are big, dumb fun, they don\\'t come much bigger -- and they certainly don\\'t come any dumber (or funner!) -- than Sahara. Sahara won\\'t be competing for any Oscars, but it is goofy, light-hearted fun. ..a rollicking, wild adventure in which a very buff Matthew McConaughey, and his able sidekick, Steve Zahn, have more fun than any movie pair since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover The movie, first preposterously entertaining and then just preposterous, makes James Bond films look as logical as Euclidean geometry. While it doesn\\'t rewrite the genre, it finds a way to deliver with style and humor everything adventure fans want. The characters are too thin, the violence too careless, the suspension of disbelief required too strenuous, the treatment of non-whites too stereotyped. The plotting is too complex for a generally stupid picture, but that didn\\'t stop me from getting sucked in by director Breck Eisner\\'s nicely paced action sequences. It would have worked better with a funnier and more believable script. As popcorn goes, this one\\'s a value-size box. In one spit-take-inducing moment, our heroes convert a wrecked prop plane into a desert sailboat, which they race across the sand to the strains of \\'Magic Carpet Ride.\\' A little Indiana Jones, a little James Bond, a little Tom Clancy -- it all adds up to an action-adventure flick with little to distinguish it. A silly and morally vacant movie. Sahara is pretty to look at but lacks the adrenaline charge of the movies it\\'s so obviously trying to emulate. McConaughey\\'s no Harrison Ford. And no one cracks the whip of originality. Is it cheesy fun or just cheesy? Just cheesy. Highly entertaining romp from the pen of airport pulp king Clive Cussler. Feels as plodding and fruitless as trekking the length of a desert on a pogo stick with a busted spring. &#46;&#46;&#46; what we get with &#8220;Sahara&#8221; is a gritty&#44; riveting war drama that transports us to another place and time&#44; far off in a no man&#8217;s land&#44; with characters who are believable and multidimensional&#46; \"Sahara\" is a laudable conception of soldier fortitude in this war, and it is also a bang-up action picture, cut out to hold one enthralled. The film is passably entertaining, in no small part because of Steve Zahn. A pretty offensive comedy about Africans who range from primitive to demonic that, sorry, is just not funny. [A]s delightful a bit of... hokum as we\\'ve seen in some time. You don\\'t take it seriously for a minute... [Y]ou get a big bag of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy. Offers action-adventure as enjoyable as it is preposterous. McConaughey and Zahn\\'s casual interplay makes the film. It\\'s no wonder the highly mechanized finished product feels so unfulfilling A big, goofy, entirely disposable, tons-o-fun Hollywood Action Flick. If Sahara weren\\'t quite so dumb, it might have been a lot of fun. One of the best WWII-era WWII movies&#133; a thoroughly entertaining war actioner starring Humphrey Bogart as a tough American sergeant commanding a tank crew in the Libyan desert. With Matthew McConaughey in the lead role, there is plenty of dash, lots of adventure and just enough sex appeal. Whatever it lacks in substance it makes up for in gloss, humor and thrills, and a good time should be had by all. How seriously can you take a movie in which Penelope Cruz, wearing a bucket of eye make-up, plays a World Health Organization physician who investigates plagues? Bogey\\'s presence lends a hard-boiled nature to the picture. What little humor Sahara has is forced, and of the goofy, \\'buddy-film\\' shenanigans variety. Matthew McConaughey ... makes a bid to become the next swashbuckling matinee idol. Not that there\\'s much swash to buckle in the middle of the world\\'s largest desert. Mindless, but fun and entertaining. It\\'s sort of James Bondish without the ridiculous special effects. I enjoyed it, mainly because of McConaughey and Zahn. Arid as the sand-covered dunes, \"Sahara\" is a made-for-TV flick disguised as the return of Indiana Jones. \\'...best described as Tom Clancy meets Indiana Jones.\\' Mostly, the movie seems to exist as an excuse to blow things up and rig massive stunts. Even the brain-dead National Treasure tried harder than this. The adventures are non-stop but reality gets buried in the sand. Eisner shows himself to be a solid helmer of complex and beautifully staged action sequences with a sure ear for character interplay and an exact eye for glorious widescreen framing with nods to images from Lawrence of Arabia. Sahara is a movie with Indiana Jones aspirations that plays more like a low-rent 007 clone. Good-natured junk that amuses while it\\'s onscreen, and evaporates almost immediately afterward. The movie is based on a novel by Cussler, who\\'s reportedly sued the movie on the grounds that he was promised and denied ultimate script approval. More\\'s the pity. He\\'d surely have given us an ironclad ending. Although the movie isn\\'t great, it is kinda fun. Easy to look at and even easier to forget. On the occasional moment when McConaughey actually works himself up to being heroic, Sahara positively soars. The film\\'s greatest secret weapon is its hip, young cast. Feels like a carbon copy of the real thing. A blockbuster played by action figures and written by children. The whole concept is just too stupid to go along with, and would make the movie bad enough on its own if it wasn\\'t a contender for the most racist film ever made. Has enough humor and adventure that I\\'m almost willing to overlook the preposterous plot A really, really dumb film, but it\\'s lots and lots of fun and entirely lacking in malice. Cussler\\'s attempt to make his concept of an ironclad ship making its way from Richmond to the African desert is no more credible on film than on the written page. Like other WWII adventures, Sahara contains elements of propaganda, but it\\'s expertly directed by Korda, well acted by Bogart and the other men, and strikingly photographed by Rudolph Mate who received an Oscar nomination. Sahara rather resembles National Treasure, another film with a strained story line and deadening lack of visual richness. The key questions is: Can Matthew McConaughey make Dirk Pitt into another Indiana Jones? ...will leave a parched sensation in one\\'s dry throat...a recycled buddy-buddy vehicle that\\'s about as welcoming as hugging a cactus tree With this strong of a cast this film should have been much better. To get a franchise going, you need your own style, and this movie hasn\\'t an original thought on anything. Anyone with even the slightest awareness of global politics will cringe at dialogue like \"No one cares about Africa\" and the notion that good old fashioned American cunning will always triumph, no matter how dire the circumstances. When Sahara stops being about Dirk and Al\\'s misadventures and starts being about viruses and mass murder, it loses its way. Sahara is one of those rare film that is sunk completely as a fault of the cast.... It just goes to show that sometimes Hollywood gets its own formula wrong. It tried to be National Treasure and it failed. Zoltan Korda\\'s wartime coalition is more Air Force muscularity than In Which We Serve fustiness The whole movie is a kick&#44; actually&#46; I can\\'t figure out just what I didn\\'t like about this film, but I know I didn\\'t really enjoy it. This is what action movie should be... Dirk Pitt is a hero who would make James Bond buy him a drink and make XXX wet his pants. It\\'s about good ol\\' boys on a rip-snorting adventure, and to that end, it succeeds. Then again, women still swoon with lust whenever McConaughey steps in front of the camera, no matter how rancid is the project he deems fit to appear in right now. I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level, which must mean (I am forced to conclude) in my own dumb way. Steve Zahn rocks! Though at times the film certainly stretches the believability factor, it is always engaging, always fun. Mightily agreeable foolishness ... one of the few cases where the phrase, \"the book was better,\" actually doesn\\'t apply. Believable? Nah. But when a movie is this fun, who cares? For all its flaws, Sahara still works as a C+ discount-matinee time-waster. Boat chases, gunfights, and stunts galore The mindless Sahara is smart enough to keep the action and wisecracks at a fevered clip. ...nobody could\\'ve expected the unbelievable sense of dullness that\\'s permeating every aspect of the film. A shame this slick vehicle often stalls in a traffic jam of action-adventure cliches and unnecessary mucking about. The casting is so strong and the overall filmmaking flair of the movie is so captivating that it basically works, perhaps even well enough to join its producer Mace Neufeld\\'s Tom Clancy adaptations as a major new movie franchise. Vapid, lengthy, and mostly lifeless -- kind of like the desert it\\'s named for. Sahara falls into quicksand and quickly disappears into the abyss that can only be described as Movie Hell. Only one word can describe this thing, baby: Craptacular. A mediocre action-adventure flick that\\'s compelling only for its strange mixture of B-movie elements and a completely hollow social consciousness. One of those action films that require the bad guys to be utterly inept marksmen and feature action sequences that are both implausible and difficult to follow. Sahara isn\\'t exactly a prestigious Merchant-Ivory production, and it doesn\\'t pretend to be. Meet it on its level of entertainment, and a good time is sure to be had. Good-natured enough to entertain here and there, but that otherwise loses its way long before the characters complete their implausible quest. A surprisingly fun action comedy with a cast that connects. jumps from plotline to plotline, stringing them together with a series of action setpieces that fulfill their obligations, but little more Spectacularly silly and perversely entertaining. The one-liners, mostly bland, are used so liberally that they water down the action. Stands as one more bit of throwback entertainment that\\'s better than I expected -- and not much more. Pity, because McConaughey is born to play Pitt. Whether his shirt is on or off (personally I prefer the later) the actor cuts a dashing figure. What it is is a big summer action movie that would have been hot stuff about 30 years ago but looks tired and worn today despite a perky, attractive cast that refuses to wilt in the desert sun. As Hollywood actioners go these days, this one\\'s quite tolerable in its guilty-pleasure way. Feel free to saddle up. Second-rate adventure. We get it, guys...there\\'s a treasure in the desert...just get to it already!! Thanks to the strong performance by Bogey, at his heroic best, it\\'s watchable. The plot flies in too many directions, and the derring-do stunts are ho-hum. The secret ingredient that makes this handsome thriller so enjoyable is the chemistry between Alpha-male McConaughey and zany Zahn. Eisner is not remotely up to the challenge. Spending millions on action scenes does not mean you get them right. Otherwise dismissive reviews of Sahara have been forgiving it on the grounds that it\\'s entertaining. Allow me to counter that opinion: No, it isn\\'t. A breezy summer action thriller that knows just what it is and has a ball being just that. The final product is more like a collection of genre clichs than a compelling story. ...like having a swimsuit full of sand. As action-adventures go, Sahara may not be as close to the tradition of Indiana Jones as it wants to be, but it is still slightly better than average. The most exciting adventure based on a third-rate paperback and directed by the son of a movie mogul ever produced! Which is to say, not actually exciting at all. It drove me crazy. It made National Treasure look like a documentary. Just when the silliness seems too much, viewers get distracted by the amusing antics of a first-rate supporting cast. Sahara is such an enigmatic piece of filmmaking that it never settles on a tone and whose downtime in-between the action is going to ease audiences into a gentle slumber. This is a big, lively romp, filmed in a lushly expansive epic style even though it\\'s basically low-rent James Bond. The many adventures... serve to hide the lack of dramatic resources from this beautiful model named Brooke Shields. [Full Review in Spanish] For a popcorn movie, it\\'s a bit stale. In short, Sahara is a hugely enjoyable, old fashioned adventure movie of the sort that they really don\\'t make anymore. It\\'s worth seeing just for the chemistry between its three leads. A mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche. All actors have a movie or two that they would like to forget. Matthew McConaughey, Penelope Cruz and William H. Macy should put this preposterous action-adventure flick at the top of their lists. Not quite as fun as \"National Treasure,\" but far better than Dennis Quaid\\'s doomed \"Flight of the Phoenix.\" A testosterone-drenched escapade that misses because it lacks the tension to make it a thrill ride.

Who cares? It\\'s still fun, exciting and thoroughly entertaining 100 percent of its character development takes place in the opening credit montage.

Just don\\'t go expecting complex moral and ethical quandaries and you\\'ll likely never think of Ishtar even once. Watchable more for its strong cast than for its credibility or its pretensions ... For people thirsty for the kind of sub-Indiana Jones adventure that used to pop up on your local UHF stations all weekend long, Sahara fills a real niche. Productions this guiltlessly corny need real personalities to sell them, and unlike the dull National Treasure, Sahara has a few. Clive Cussler needs to calm down and quit complaining.

A largely entertaining version of Clive Cussler\\'s novel, with Matthew McConaughey delivering the goods as the adventurous Dirk Pitt. A stunning piece of work -- stunningly inept, stunningly incoherent, stunningly awful in every single way imaginable. McConaughney plays the role of dashing adventurer Dirk Pitt as if he were a party-hardy frat boy who ventured out into the real world after all campus kegs were tapped dry. We flip through the usual catalog of close-call explosions, firefights and chases in which the weaponry is as lovingly photographed as the bronzed McConaughey and gorgeous Cruz. Travels down been-there-done-that territory, afraid to take chances and unaware of its own tedious mediocrity. Someone had the brilliant idea to treat Sahara as a Hope and Crosby \"Road\" picture pasted onto a James Bond/Indiana Jones plot.'"
